**TL;DR**: Lily (Low-Rank Interconnected Adaptation across Layers) is a novel PEFT method with cross-layer connections, allowing each layer to access information from all other layers during the adaptation process, as well as high-rank weight updates.

**Experiment setups from the paper are located in each subfolder.**
